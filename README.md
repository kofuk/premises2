# Premises2

Premises2 is software to launch on-premises Minecraft servers on Open Stack,
inspired by the ease of use found in managed services like [Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/realms).
It attempts to simplify the complexities of Open Stack, enabling users to launch their
Minecraft servers without requiring extensive technical knowledge.

Premises2 is the successor to [Premises](https://github.com/kofuk/premises), and shares many concepts with it.
